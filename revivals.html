        <p>NaturaUI, Restore nature to life!</p>
        <p>by IOrbitSaturn</p>
        <p>Description</p>
        <p>You know when nature was king on phones and they randomly made everything flat? Well, i had no tolerance to that, so i always used the GS3, untill it broke, but now, i can make my own theme for OneUI, made by hackers, designed for users. (OneUI Core based, might work on OneUI)</p>

        <p>OxygenUI, the clean interface</p>
        <p>by IOrbitSaturn</p>
        <p>Description</p>
        <p>AOSP, you know it? It's the OS that your phone might be derivated on if you didnt install a GSI or you dont use LineageOS (or Cyanogenmod if youre a crackhead), but its interface is boring, so lets jump on to OxygenUI, the interface for the Oxygen "Fan-Phones"</p>

        <p>by IOrbitSaturn</p>
        <p>Description</p>
        <p>So, your phone is old and rusty, but can handle AOSP of any kind from Android 5 to 11? Guess what? We have an OxygenUI for you, OxygenUI Core, for those phones that rival new Samsungs</p>
